		Amsterdam is situated 20 km from the sea, at the point where river Amstel joins 
		the river IJ. The city has a population of about 750,000 and is the country's

		For a fairly small city, Amsterdam has a surprisingly large number of museums and 
		galleries.Traditional art-lovers know the route to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum. 
		But modern art too is richly represented in Amsterdam, with the Stedelijk Museum and 
		the Cobra museum in Amstelveen to name just two. There is a plenty of galleries, 
		especially in the Spiegelkwartier and in the Jordaan. And if you want to experience more 
		of nature, then the gardens of the universities and Artis Zoo are the right addresses. 
		In a nutshell, there are lot of things to see in Amsterdam.</p>

		Amsterdam. They are spanned by many beautiful bridges, including the famous Magere Brug, 
		a traditionally stylled lift bridge. You can simply relax at a canalside cafe and watch 
		an array of boats float by, or take a canal tour.</p>
